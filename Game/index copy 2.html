  "content": "This document outlines the structured file organization for the game project, ensuring clarity in implementation and development handoff. Each component is defined with its purpose, utilization strategy, and relationship to other elements, thus providing a comprehensive guide for developers to maintain continuity and facilitate seamless game experience delivery.\n\n1. **index.html**:\n   - **Purpose**: Main entry point of the game, structuring basic HTML layout.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Includes essential HTML5 boilerplate, `<canvas>` for rendering, links to `style.css` and scripts (`game.js`, `ui.js`, etc.). Integrate metadata for responsiveness and optimize script loading with async/defer attributes.\n   - **Dependencies**: Loads `style.css`, `game.js`, `ui.js`, `matter.min.js`, `ai.js`, `inputs.js`, and `stats.min.js`.\n\n2. **style.css**:\n   - **Purpose**: Governs aesthetic presentation and layout styling.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Define a dynamic color scheme with responsive layout strategies like grid or flexbox. Include typographic consistency and spatial arrangement to enhance usability.\n   - **Dependencies**: Relies on class/ID definitions in `index.html`.\n\n3. **game.js**:\n   - **Purpose**: Centralized logic for game initialization, core mechanics, and state management.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Maintain modular functions for player actions (jumping, shooting), state machines for transitions, optimized performance logic. Incorporate libraries like Matter.js for physics.\n   - **Dependencies**: Interacts with `matter.min.js`, `ai.js`, `inputs.js`.\n\n4. **ui.js**:\n   - **Purpose**: Manages user interface dynamics and interactive elements.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Employ JavaScript classes for menus, dynamic transitions, and animations tied to gameplay narratives.\n   - **Dependencies**: Collaborates with `game.js` for UI state-driven changes.\n\n5. **assets/**:\n   - **images/**: Stores visual assets like characters and UI elements. Organize subdirectories for easy access.\n   - **audio/**: Stores soundtracks and sound effects. Ensure named according to use case for ease of adaptation.\n\n6. **matter.min.js**:\n   - **Purpose**: Physics engine library for realistic game interactions.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Documented usage for physics simulation; emphasis on performance efficiency.\n   - **Dependencies**: Precedes `game.js` in logic utilization.\n\n7. **ai.js**:\n   - **Purpose**: Commands AI behavior for non-player character interactions.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Develop AI actions as classes/functions supporting modular scalability.\n   - **Dependencies**: Coordinated via `game.js`.\n\n8. **level-data.json**:\n   - **Purpose**: Level configuration file for modular expansion.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Key-value pairs for game elements like obstacles and adversaries, designed for easy level adjustments.\n   - **Dependencies**: Accessed by `game.js` during initialization.\n\n9. **stats.min.js**:\n   - **Purpose**: Performance monitoring library used in development.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Provides real-time game metrics for optimization tracking.\n   - **Dependencies**: Loaded last to prevent user experience impact.\n\n10. **inputs.js**:\n   - **Purpose**: Manages capture and execution of game inputs.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Implement event listeners for controls, with considerations for responsiveness.\n   - **Dependencies**: Direct linkage with `game.js` for gameplay interaction.\n\n11. **animations.css**:\n   - **Purpose**: CSS-based animations for UI and game transitions.\n   - **Content Guidelines**: Detailed rules for animations using libraries like GSAP, ensuring synchronized visual feedback.\n   - **Dependencies**: Integrated with `ui.js` driven elements.\n\nThis FileStructureSpec ensures each file serves its definitive role, maintaining the cohesion and quality required to deliver a cutting-edge gaming experience. Dependencies and content guidelines are meticulously documented to aid future developments.",
