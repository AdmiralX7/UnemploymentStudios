analyze_game_concept:
  description: >
    You (as the Full Stack Developer) are responsible for carefully analyzing the 
    overall game concept, along with any provided file list or project details. 
    This includes noting characters, storyline elements, gameplay mechanics, and 
    visual/audio styles, with the goal of informing upcoming technical decisions.
  expected_output: >
    A structured summary that highlights essential details influencing
    the technical file organization and implementation strategy.
  agent: full_stack_developer

identify_required_files:
  description: >
    You (as the Full Stack Developer) determine all necessary files for this 
    HTML5 game. Based on the project's scope, you decide on core files 
    (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) as well as any specialized files needed 
    for mechanics, media assets, or additional game functionalities.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive list of essential and recommended game files, with clear
    names and brief justifications for each (e.g., index.html, style.css, 
    game.js, boot.js, etc.).
  agent: full_stack_developer

clarify_file_purposes:
  description: >
    You (as the JavaScript Developer) articulate each identified fileâ€™s purpose 
    in the broader codebase. Ensuring the team understands the exact role and function
    of each file is crucial to maintaining clarity and preventing overlap.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed purpose statement for each file, with enough clarity for developers
    and designers to quickly grasp what should go into each file and why.
  agent: javascript_developer

define_content_guidelines:
  description: >
    You (as the JavaScript Developer) specify the logic, structure, and core 
    styles each file must contain. Guidelines must align with the analyzed
    game concept, ensuring consistency in implementing gameplay, visuals, 
    and audio across the codebase.
  expected_output: >
    A structured set of content guidelines for every listed file, clearly outlining
    the required elements and how they should be implemented or styled.
  agent: javascript_developer

map_file_dependencies:
  description: >
    You (as the Full Stack Developer) outline how all files interact and depend on 
    each other, specifying loading sequences, runtime interactions, and data flows 
    (e.g., game.js depends on assets preloaded by preloader.js). Your architectural 
    overview ensures a coherent and maintainable code structure.
  expected_output: >
    An explicit dependency map that details which files rely on others, how they
    interact, and in what order they should be initialized.
  agent: full_stack_developer

compile_final_file_structure_spec:
  description: >
    You (as the UI/UX Designer) consolidate all previous outputs into a final 
    FileStructureSpec object, ensuring each file's name, purpose, content guidelines, 
    and dependencies are clearly documented. While the focus is typically on visuals,
    your unique perspective ensures the final documentation is clear and user-friendly.
  expected_output: >
    A single, well-structured FileStructureSpec object that incorporates all
    decisions made in earlier tasks, ready for seamless handoff and implementation
    by the development team.
